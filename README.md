# Imposter.io (Deprecated)

**Overview:**

Imposter.io is a game inspired by "Faker" in The Jackbox Party Pack 3 and the popular game Among Us. It offers an engaging multiplayer experience where players are assigned either the crew mate or imposter role. The objective is simple: complete tasks and identify the imposter among the crew.

**Gameplay:**

- Players are divided into crew mates and imposters.
- Each round, players receive the same task, with the imposter's task slightly modified.
- After completing tasks, results are revealed to all players.
- Players vote for the individual they suspect is the imposter.
- Imposters use tactics like lying, deceiving, and misdirection to avoid being voted out.

**Technology Stack:**

- Frontend developed with React.js and Chakra UI for an interactive and visually appealing experience.
- Backend powered by Node.js and socket.io for real-time communication, enhancing the multiplayer gameplay.
